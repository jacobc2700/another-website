My personal website.

### Technologies:

- There are two different versions of this website.
- One version is made with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- One version is made with React.

responsive web design:

- favicon with profile photo
- center the heading and button on home page
- hide the brackets that show technologies on smaller screens
- more margin between projects
- convert to a react project when finished with the HTML version...
- put comments organizing the styles
- links in about me section
- link to source for this website
  add particle js
  media query, to center the other projects section whenever the technologies list goes away
  button from eng. website that brings you all the way back up
