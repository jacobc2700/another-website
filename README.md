My personal website.

### Technologies:

- There are two different versions of this website.
- The original version of this website was made with these technologies:
- Bootstrap (Darkly), Font Awesome, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery.
- I decided to make a second version of this website with React because there was too much code reuse with the HTML version.

responsive web design:

- favicon with profile photo
- center the heading and button on home page
- hide the brackets that show technologies on smaller screens
- more margin between projects
- convert to a react project when finished with the HTML version...
- put comments organizing the styles
- links in about me section
- link to source for this website
  add particle js
  media query, to center the other projects section whenever the technologies list goes away
  button from eng. website that brings you all the way back up
