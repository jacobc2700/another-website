### Technologies:

- Bootstrap (Darkly) & CSS.
- JavaScript & jQuery.
- Particles.js.
- Font Awesome.
- Devicons.
- HTML.

### Problems to Fix:

- Organize the code (constant colors and units).
- Add a dark mode.
- React project?
- Button hover and hold (light mode) needs to be changed.
- Change background color for sections.
- Add a grey border division between sections?
- Change green to blue for modal buttons (light mode).
- Footer tool tips (light mode) need to be light.
- Add different particles for light mode home page (check other branch: weird-dark-mode).
- Just use: #f7f2e7 for the sections.
