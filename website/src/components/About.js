              My name is Jacob Chang and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I'm
              currently a senior in high school and I love computer programming.
              I spend my free time developing web applications and learning new
              technologies. I am currently working on three large-scale projects
              with JavaScript, Java, and Python. I use JavaScript for my web
              applications, Java for data structures & algorithms, and Python
              for my data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence
              projects. When I'm not programming, you can find me playing the
              piano or making videos.
